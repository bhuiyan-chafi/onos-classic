# ONOS: Open Network Operating System

## What is ONOS?

ONOS is the only SDN controller platform that supports the transition from legacy “brown field” networks to SDN “green field” networks. This enables exciting new capabilities, and disruptive deployment and operational cost points for network operators.

## Top-Level Features

- High availability through clustering and distributed state management.
- Scalability through clustering and sharding of network device control.
- Performance that is good for a first release, and which has an architecture that will continue to support improvements.
- Northbound abstractions for a global network view, network graph, and application intents.
- Pluggable southbound for support of OpenFlow, P4Runtime, and new or legacy protocols.
- Graphical user interface to view multi-layer topologies and inspect elements of the topology.
- REST API for access to Northbound abstractions as well as CLI commands.
- CLI for debugging.
- Support for both proactive and reactive flow setup.
- SDN-IP application to support interworking with traditional IP networks controlled by distributed routing protocols such as BGP.
- IP-Optical use case demonstration.

For the final official version please switch to `master` branch.

## About This Fork

This repository is a fork of the original **Open Network Operating System (ONOS)** controller originally developed and maintained by the **Open Networking Foundation (ONF)**.

### Upstream Repository Status

The original official upstream repository previously cloned via:

```bash
git clone https://gerrit.onosproject.org/onos
```

is no longer available or actively maintained.

### Motivation behind the fork

This fork is going to be maintained for **educational and research purposes** by [Alessio Giorgetti](https://github.com/alessiocnit), an active contributor to the official upstream ONOS repository (with contributions including optical network extensions and ODTN drivers). The goal of this project is to keep ONOS accessible, buildable on modern environments, and ready for use in SDN labs, experiments, and research.
